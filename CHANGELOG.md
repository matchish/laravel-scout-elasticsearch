### Added
- ElasticParams trait, that adds 'getElasticsearchScore' and 'getElasticsearchHighlight' to the model after performing a search.

- a new option "--parallel" for ImportCommand, can only be used with [Trackable-Jobs](https://github.com/mateusjunges/trackable-jobs-for-laravel) package currently.

## Changed
- StageInterface now has two more functions. Both are used to make PullFromSource stage an iterable one.

- When possible (model without a custom key), by default fromScope is used instead of pageScope.
